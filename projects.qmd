Below are selected academic projects showcasing my hands-on experience with data analytics and machine learning using tools such as PySpark, Pandas, Plotly, and Quarto.

## Project 1: Regression Modeling on Employment Data

**Tools**: PySpark, Pandas, Seaborn, EC2, GitHub  
**Objective**: Built and evaluated a linear regression model on job market data from the Lightcast dataset to predict salary outcomes.

- Performed full feature engineering pipeline, including imputation, encoding, and vector assembly.
- Trained and evaluated a linear regression model with PySpark MLlib.
- Interpreted key metrics like RMSE, MAE, RÂ² and assessed model quality with diagnostic plots.
- The entire project was conducted on an AWS EC2 instance and version-controlled via GitHub.

## Project 2: Insight from Data and Visualizations

**Tools**: PySpark, Pandas, Plotly, EC2, GitHub  
**Objective**: This project focused on exploring and visualizing job market data from the Lightcast dataset, with a particular emphasis on how education levels and remote work settings influence salary outcomes.

### Key Tasks & Workflow:
- Processed the raw dataset using PySpark and performed initial data cleaning and type casting.
- Converted Spark DataFrame into Pandas format for flexible visualization.
- Used group-based median imputation to fill missing salary data.
- Created separate scatter plots and histograms to reveal trends by education and remote work type.

### Visual Assets:

#### Education vs Salary
Clear separation in average salaries was observed between job seekers holding Bachelor's or lower degrees and those with Master's or PhDs.

#### Remote Work vs Salary
Onsite jobs showed greater variation in salaries across experience levels compared to remote or hybrid roles.

### Outcome:
Through this visualization-based analysis, I developed a deeper understanding of how categorical features like education and work type can be used to segment salary expectations and communicate job market patterns. Each plot was accompanied by Markdown-based narrative insights and deployed to GitHub with organized HTML output.
